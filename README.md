# Scripts for Cisco Catalyst Center

In this repository, I share my Python scripts for Cisco Catalyst Center. 
Please note that I used version 2.3.7.9-75335. 
It is possible that the APIs have changed in newer versions.

## Setup

"In my Python scripts, I use a `.env` file for my secrets. 

Example:

```env
# Cisco Catalyst Center Variables
# IP Address or URL of the Cisco Catalyst Center
DNAC_HOST=0.0.0.0
# Username for Cisco Catalyst Center
DNAC_USER=replaceme
# Password for Cisco Catalyst Center
DNAC_PASS=replaceme
```
